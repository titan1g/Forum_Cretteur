### SQLite  ### 

In order to store the data in your forum (like users, posts, comments, etc.) you will use the database library SQLite.

SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers. It enables you to create a database as well as controlling it by using queries.

### image-upload ### 
In forum image upload, registered users have the possibility to create a post containing an image as well as text.

When viewing the post, users and guests should see the image associated to it.
There are various extensions for images like: JPEG, SVG, PNG, GIF, etc. In this project you have to handle at least JPEG, PNG and GIF types.

The max size of the images to load should be 20 mb. If there is an attempt to load an image greater than 20mb, an error message should inform the user that the image is too big.

This project will help you learn about:

Image manipulation
Image types
